All of our characters were summoned by the Prince of Manila to introduce ourselves and be accepted to vampire society.
- The Prince of Manila is known as a puppet according to Gigi

The gang was given a task to scout out an abandoned building and check for signs of Sabbat activity. We were told if there was anyone there to kill them and make sure that the Masquerade was not broken.

The property we went to look at is in Malates(?) (A place for parties, clubs, somewhere near the red light district). It is two floors with the entrance being on the second floor that can be reached by stairs. There are supernatural happenings in the club.

The gang split into 3 groups:
- Convenience store: Aimee, Naomi
	- Seduced the security guard
- Building: Rachel, Lin, Santiago
	- Nothing of note
- Van: Monsieur
	- Analysed the pattern of the car seats, read the seams of the seats and deduced that there were 5 bodies and shovels inside

Once we got inside the building we noticed the lights were off. The gang then split into 2 groups to investigate:
- Kitchen: Rachel, Lin, Monsieur
	- Managed to turn on the power, heard a click downstairs
- Comfort Room (Washroom): Naomi, Aimee, Santiago
	- Found sinks that were knocked over
	- Naomi felt breathing on her neck and saw a shadow in the mirror

As the group was investigating there was a clicking sound by the entrance so we all hid. 6 guys came in - gang members that were originally hanging out in the property - and we killed them all:
- Monsieur and Naomi interrogated and converted a guy into the religion of Naomi

A man named Tuper had been away for a few days and according to this guy the Sabbat vampires were up to something. We also retrieved a code to the first floor.

Monsieur erased information on the phone from the newly religious man regarding messages with Tuper. 

Went down to the first floor and found blood splatters everywhere (Rachel may or may not have licked the blood on the floor). Monsieur analysed the blood pattern and had a vision of 'Ivory towers, men of iron, sabbat, war will come, DREAMERS'

"The sixth age has begun
The golden court will come from Chinatown
They will come"

Golden court = Indonesian vampires?

A hand suddenly pops out of the ground and a naked guy with a third eye appears.
