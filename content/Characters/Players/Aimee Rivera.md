#### Description
Clan Toreador, 13th gen. played by Judy
Age: 25
Nationality: Philippines
Race: Asian

From an early age, Aimee had been inexplicably drawn to music, often humming along to tunes she would hear while walking the streets. She found herself particularly drawn to R&B and as a teen sought to become a noteworthy performer herself. Despite her mother's strong opposition to her choice in career, Aimee flourished as a singer, always striving to give a perfect performance for her audience. One night she was approached by a mysterious stranger who offered her a promise: a lifetime of youth and beauty, and an undying pursuit of music. Struck by temptation and the promise of eternal mastery, Aimee agreed.

Aimee is driven by perfection: particularly when it comes to the pursuit of vocal mastery. She wishes to one day become a master of vocal technique and become a legend, whether that be as a human or as an immortal being.

Aimee gives off the vibe of a carefree, vivacious woman, someone who relishes the finer things in life. However, she is incredibly sensitive about her reputation and how she comes off to others. Her image is carefully constructed to what she believes is the perfect woman and she prefers to keep things that way.
