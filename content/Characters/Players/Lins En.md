#### Description
Clan Nosferatu, 13th gen. played by Franky
Age: Late 20's
Nationality: Philippines
Race: Chinese/Filipino
Sex: Male

Lins was born to an average family. Being the middle child and shorter than usual, he doesn't receive much attention nor notices. Having used to being ignored, he slowly mastered the art of stealth and blending in. His older brother (bright, intelligent) and younger sister (quick-witted, promising). His love for his siblings are only matched by his desire to stand on even ground with them. Using his small frame and talent, he sneaks the answers keys before the exam, he pilfers secrets of his opponent, he spirits trade info before the transaction. In this age of technology, he knew hacking is a must tool in obtaining knowledge.

On a seemingly regular night, Lins returns to find 4 people leaving his house. He was unnoticed by the unknown assailant by the cover of darkness. Yet his siblings were gone. To this day, Lins looks for them; any info, any knowledge of them, are up for grabs.

He is short and slim with sharp eyes. He has short hair and a clean shaven face, not someone you would perceive as a threat. Always on the look for a locked safe, a closed door and sealed envelope.
