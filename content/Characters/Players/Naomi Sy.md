#### Description
Clan Brujah, 12th gen. played by Effie
Age: Early 20's
Nationality: Japanese
Race: Chinese/Japanese
Sex: Female

Naomi was born in Manila to a Chinese-Filipino father and a Japanese mother. Her mother was an environmental scientist who moved to Japan to work with a local NGO and to teach sustainability practices in the 70's. Her father was a successful businessman. Naomi grew up in Manila but moved to Japan in her teens. She attended HS and university in Japan and continued her grad studies in Belgium. She was involved in eco-activism from a young age and took issue with the conformist culture in Japan. She was involved in eco-civil disobedience groups in Belgium. She was Embraced in Belgium by a Brujah who shared her passion for the planet. She decided to abandon her PhD studies and return to the Philippines as she felt the widespread corruption would provide a better avenue or pushing her environmental agenda as opposed to bureaucracy elsewhere. She joined Green Horizon in late 2004 and worked her way up rapidly. On the surface, she pushes for international eco-activism, fighting corporations in Manila that exploit the country's natural resources, but underneath she sees humans as the major catalyst of environmental destruction and believes that human population must be controlled through aggressive measures. She is known to have a terrible sleep schedule and therefore leaves her assistant director of operations to do most of the day-to-day running of Green Horizon. She prefers dressing in Japanese-style casual-but-tidy fashion.
