Sired Lins.

A former bounty hunter in his prime. His shadowlike skills are a step above. From common criminal to offender of the highest order, all are tracked and "subdued" by Ken. 

Alas Ken's been in the field too long, no longer as motivated and wanting to take a back seat. He embraced Lins, knowing the price of information can fetch as much as a price of a head.
