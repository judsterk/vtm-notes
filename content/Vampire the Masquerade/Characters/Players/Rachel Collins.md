#### Description
Clan Tremere, 13th gen. played by Gwen
Age: Early 30's
Nationality: UK
Race: Korean
Sex: Female

Rachel was a young scholar from the UK with a background in archaeology and a secret passion for ancient rituals, which eventually got herself too close to the vampires. The Tremere clan in particular saw her expertise as a potential asset in their pursuit of Thaumaturgy and Embrace her. After the Embrace she continued her research with much greater interest in blood magic and occult practices. She relocated to Manila, drawn by the region's mystical traditions, and continues her work at the University of Manila.

She is mainly driven by curiosity and desire for knowledge. She seeks to uncover the hidden knowledge of occult/blood magic and also secretly hopes to use this knowledge to increase her influence within the Tremere clan.
