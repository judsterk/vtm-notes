A fight ensued with shovelheads:
- A vampire with a third eye, screaming in the center
- A vampire, woman in rages, super speed running around the room, also incredibly pale (frenzy)
- A vampire whose face was rotting, also incredibly buff
- A fourth vampire that was hairy and howling

After the fight everyone began investigating the room:
- Aimee recovered her tooth after her curb stomping
- Naomi searched the basement for boxes
	- Noticed that the building was owned by one person > Malolo de Jesus
		- Owner of the restaurant (2nd floor), convenience store (1st floor), and hair salon (1st floor, hidden path)
- Santiago began decapitating all the bodies that were buried just in case they came back to life
- Lin searched for any sign of an entryway
	- He found a thin wall of plaster and began to tear it down

As Lin tore down the plaster a thick smell of rotting meat wafted into the room. Once the plaster was fully pulled back we could see what was once the hair salon. In the middle of the salon was a giant throne made of flesh and bone that seemed to be breathing and pulsing. Voices began to come out of the chair of several different people. 

Monsieur has another vision.

"New York, it's progenitor, the disease infests to suffer, the chair, Koldun!"

Koldun -> a form of magic, practiced by clan Tzimisce
- Flesh magic, SABBAT

Lin tries throwing a dead human body on the chair. The throne makes sucking sounds and the body looks like it's being drained.

Rachel calls someone and says that they can come in and do a ritual of the place tomorrow.

After a thorough investigation we go back to tell the Prince of Manila that we've completed her project. She seems satisfied with our endeavours and tell us to burn the chair and create a business out of the building.

*THE NEXT DAY*

No one discussed when we were meeting to get to the property. Monsieur met a strange woman who called him Jeff and talked about how she had been looking for him and how his kids were waiting for him. Jeff ran away to Santiago's house.

A vampire named Bill comes with Rachel to the building and checks out the ghosts in the building. The ghosts don't respond but they don't seem dangerous.

After some investigation it is concluded that the throne is made of ghouls. We began hacking at it but found the throne screamed out in ecstasy too loud. Monsieur distracted the nearby officers who came to check out the noise. He became acquainted with them and learned their names: Inspector Manuel and Inspector Jose. 

We eventually hacked up the chair by killing it with several bottles of insect repellent and drove the pieces in garbage bags to a remote field that Naomi's company had to burn them.

Aimee negotiated with Belle to get some acts to play at the bar they decide to open. With the agreement to free MTV Asia advertising we get New Metal band acts on Thursdays and Fridays at the bar.

We name the bar "Sinister Spirits".

Monsieur has another vision.

"3 shadows in our future at the bar. One of their friends are hurt at the bar. One of them has to eat another person."

"One must eat the other who runs free before him. Put them right into his mouth."

*3 WEEKS LATER (EARLY MARCH)*

Business is proceeding well, vampires have now started flocking to the bar. The bar attracts 2 general crowds:
- Alt people and metalheads
- The regular bar crowd

Sinister Spirits also attracts a 3rd audience of ghosthunters and occult lovers, and high school kids (from rich families).
- The most common rumour going around the bar is that when you pee in the bathroom you can feel a ghost breathing down your neck

The prince is happy with our achievements and lets us have first go from the rack (the bar). She also proposes that we become a coterie(? a group of vampires from other clans who work together) in order to do some more work for the Prince.

An incident occurs: a vampire named Jobert has drank too much blood and killed a person (first time). We check the ID of the victim and get their information.

Name: Jessica Salazar
Occupation: Student
University: DeLasalle University

The last messages on her phone are to someone named 'Bro' about the bar and to bring 'the tools'.

Lin uses the dark web to search information about 'Bro'. We find a gay website with a matching name 'Bro' and phone number. The profile is the most beautiful man, and that he's a stripper who works at a nearby bar called Mr. Piggy's.

Jessica gets put into the server room on the first floor while Naomi, Aimee, and Monsieur go to scout out Bro, hoping to make him a ghoul. In the meantime a person named 'Maria' calls Jessica's phone, no one answers the call.

At Mr. Piggy's we convince him to come back to the bar with us and notice some odd things about him. Also notice that he's very much into drugs.

We bring him back to the bar and notice that he can see the ghosts in the bar. He also gyrates rapidly and seems to find out that Jessica is dead and in the server room.

We clear out the bar and take him downstairs and also calls a guy named Roach. He gets increasingly agitated and demands to kill Jobert. Aimee calms him down by using Endearment and tries to get him to drink her blood. She nearly dies in the process because he can not be blood binded and gets energy to fight.

Monsieur calls Jobert and he arrives ready to kill Bro when the fight starts. Lin takes several hits and is quite damaged. Monsieur takes his pistol and shoots him in the head, killing him instantly.

Bro's phone starts to ring and it seems to be Roach. Lin changes his voice to sound like Bro and convinces Roach that Jess is ok. Roach asks if he's ready for tomorrow and sends forward an odd app called 'Sniffer'.
